![PyMail IO](assets/pymail_logo.png?raw=true "Title")

An Asynchronous mail server.

Work in progress... please call back soon!

```bash
pip install pymail-io
```

## Mission Statement
A mail server that you can run beside a Python WSGI application with the main
objectives:

    - Ease of use - an excellent public API for Python developers
    - Fire & forget - no need to remember which tasks on which routes are waiting to be handled
    - Simple API, you won't need to learn huge task runners libraries just to send an email
    - Compatible with python 3.4 upwards
    - Compatible with WSGI & ASGI application frameworks
    - Can be used alone, not just with a WSGI/ASGI application
    - A nice modern update to the aging exiting Python mail clients
